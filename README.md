This super cute game was inspired by the Classic Mario and my nephews. It was built with Kaboom.js. The Rules: use left/right arrow keys to move, head bump helmets for surprises, collect Vans for points, jump over little brother to survive, and use the down arrow key while on top of the Mini Cooper to level up. I created all of the game art.
